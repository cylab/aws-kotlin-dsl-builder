# AWS Kotlin DSL Builder

A DSL generator based on reflection and javadoc converted to xml

## TODOs

- Configure nullability (at least for attributevalue)
- Convert javadoc html comments to real markdown
- Switch to generation based solely on javadoc xml, if possible
- Allow overriding of single dsl methods, if the generic implementation is not sufficient
- Finalize generation of gradle projects including upload to maven central
- Automatic build via GitHub CI?
- Automatic dependency update and rebuild on AWS-SDK update
- (Optional) Migration to Kotlin Flow?
